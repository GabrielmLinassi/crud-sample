# sample-crud 🔥

Is a simple project I made to learn React + Firestore. It includes:

- based on create-react-app (CRA) `16.13.1`
- navigation and routing using `react-router`
- Firebase as backend for email auth
- uses Firestore to store user data
- handles different field types in forms
- handles server errors using Formik
- Login/Signup form built using Formik & yup
- show/hide Password Field's visibility 👁
- uses Context API & checks user's auth state
- implement Password Reset Screen
- all components are functional components and use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Screens

Main screens:

- Login
- Signup
- Home
